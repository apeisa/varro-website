    <h1>Varro Money – Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Varro Money helps you track income and expenses. Your data primarily lives on your device. If you enable Google Sheets sync, the app accesses your Google account to create and update a spreadsheet in your Google Drive.</p>

    <h2>What we collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>On-device data:</strong> transactions and categories are stored locally on your device.</li>
      <li><strong>If you enable sync:</strong> the app uses your Google account to create and write to a spreadsheet you own. We request these scopes: email and spreadsheets.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How your data is used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>On-device data is used solely to power app features.</li>
      <li>If sync is enabled, the app writes and updates rows in your Google Sheets spreadsheet to back up and restore your data between devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What we don’t do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We don't have any access to your data.</li>
      <li>Therefore no selling or sharing of your data with third parties.</li>
      <li>No analytics SDKs. We don't follow how you are using this app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data retention and deletion</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Delete data by removing it in the app. To remove synced data, delete the spreadsheet from your Google Drive.</li>
      <li>You can disconnect Google Sheets sync at any time from Settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Google Sign-In is used to authenticate and obtain a short‑lived access token. Data in Google Sheets is protected by your Google account.</p>
